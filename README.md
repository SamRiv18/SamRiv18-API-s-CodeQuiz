This short quiz was created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project's goal was to provide the user with a quick 5 question quiz. The quiz scoring system is based on a count-down timer. The user's position on the leaderboard depends on how much time is left at the end of the quiz. The quiz will start with 50 seconds and count down every second unless a question is answered incorrectly. If this is the case, the app will deduct 9 seconds off the timer. Completion of the quiz will be achieved by either finishing all 5 questions or when the timer reaches 0. At the end of the quiz, the app will prompt the user to enter a username to save their score. After this, they will be able to look at the leaderboard by clicking the "High Scores" button. Then they can interact with local storage by either deleting all the current scores or starting a new attempt and testing their knowledge and speed once again.
